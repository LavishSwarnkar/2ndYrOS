CPU Scheduling
Criteria:-
1. CPU Utilization (all time busy)
2. Throughput
3. Turn Around Time (time interval between
   submission of process & execution of process)
4. Waiting Time (time for which process waits)
5. Response Time (time of first reponse of CPU)

2 Types:
1. Non Preemptive
2. Preemptive

Algorithms:-
1. FCFS(First Come First Serve)
